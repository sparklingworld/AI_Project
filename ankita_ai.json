Try holding it gently, like a leaf in your palm, and watch how slowly, softly, it fades. Brighter days are coming always tell this to yourself even when its hard okay?, I promise. Until then, you don't have to carry this alone, GOD IS ALWAYS WITH YOU okay?",

    "Listen, dear, it's okay to feel this way. Sadness isn't something to fight—let it move through you like a quiet river. Then, when you're ready, take a deep breath and look around for even the tiniest spark of light. It's always there just like I am here for you.",

    "I need you to remember something: sadness is just one chapter in your story, not the whole book. Right now might feel blurry, but clearer, sweeter moments are on their way. You've got so much ahead of you—hold on, because I believe in what's coming for you.",

    "Heyyyyy...Your tears aren't weakness—they're proof of how deeply you feel, and that takes real courage. Let them fall if they need to, then wrap yourself in kindness. Peace will find you; just give it time and always trust everything is to be okay!!!!!!!!",

Than hear that quiet whisper in your chest? It knows the right way, even when you don't. Trust it.",

      "Feeling lost doesn't mean you're off track—it means you're on the verge of something new. Keep your heart open like a window, even just a crack. Clarity has a way of slipping in when you least expect it.",

      "Darling, getting lost isn't failure—it's exploration. The detours? They lead to places straight roads never could. Yeah, the storm feels endless, but I swear the air smells different after the rain. Wait for it.",
