# AI_Project

#This project uses:

 A custom-built NLP intent detection system

 A JSON-based personality and emotional response model

 A clean frontend UI with Kibo avatar

 Flask backend deployed via Render(so need to refresh again like for atleast two times and then also have to wait to get the reply!)

#How It Works

 The user sends a message via the frontend.

 The message is sent to the backend Flask app.

 The trained ML model (ankita_intent_model.pkl) detects the intent.

 It matches the intent + emotion in json file.

 then its responds in a way that fits my given vibe and values.
